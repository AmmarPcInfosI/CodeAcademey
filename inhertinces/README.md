Sure, here's the shortened version of the README:

# README for Java Program

## Description
This Java program demonstrates a simple inheritance hierarchy between two classes, `Muscat` and `Seeb`. The `Seeb` class extends the `Muscat` class and overrides the `setPopulation` method to print the population of Seeb.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Java installed.
2. Compile and run the provided Java code (`Main.java`).

## Classes
1. `Main` Class:
   - Entry point of the program.
   - Creates `Muscat` and `Seeb` objects and sets their population values.

2. `Muscat` Class:
   - Represents the city of Muscat.
   - Properties: `population`, `area`, `cities`.
   - Method: `setPopulation()` - prints the population of Muscat.

3. `Seeb` Class:
   - Extends `Muscat` class, inheriting its properties.
   - Additional properties: `vilages`, `seebDescription`, `seebPopulation`.
   - Overrides `setPopulation()` method to print the population of Seeb.

## Example Output
```
The population of Muscat: 988866
The Population of Seeb: 50008
```

Note: This is a basic example for demonstration purposes. Feel free to modify and extend it as needed.
